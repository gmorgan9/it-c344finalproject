## Project Overview
For my project, I was able to publish a working website to my linux system. I am going to document the commands that I used to install apache2, how I got it to run, how I got it to store my website files, and how I got my website to display.

I was able to install Ubuntu Server 21.10 on my raspberry pi 3 B+. This allowed me to access my Ubuntu server via sshing into my raspberry pi via my Macbook Pro. Sshing into my Macbook Pro allowed me to access ubuntu to create an apache2 HTTP server to push my webpage to. I was able to publish this site up using a certain command, <code>sudo service apache2 start</code>.
