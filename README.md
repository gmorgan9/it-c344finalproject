I decided to do the first project listed on Alberts list of projects. I had to show how an Apache2 HTTP server works on a linux system and demonstrate a working website from my raspberry pi.

## Team Members Contribution
I ended up completing the final project alone. I was not able to find a group of people in our class to do a project.
