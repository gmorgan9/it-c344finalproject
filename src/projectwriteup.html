    Project Write-up
  </h1>
  <p>
    For this project, I was able to publish a working website to my linux system. I am going to document the commands that I used to install apache2, how I got it to run, how I got it to store my website files, and how I got my website to display. I will document this by answering the required questions below:
    <ul class="proreq">
        <li>
            How do you install apache2 (What commands did you use?)
        </li>
        <li>
            What files did it installed on your system?
        </li>
        <li>
            What files are responsible for making sure the apache2 application is running correctly? (What files are used to manage the apache2 service?)
        </li>
        <li>
            What files are used to define how apache2 works? (Whatâ€™s in the configuration file?)
        </li>
        <li>
            What other components are needed for apache2 to host a website?
        </li>
        <li>
            How do you change ports for your website?
        </li>
        <li>
            Anything else about apache2 that you think is interesting and you would like to show it to the class. 
        </li>
    </ul>
